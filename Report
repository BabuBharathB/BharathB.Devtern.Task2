1. Data Preprocessing:
Importing Libraries: You imported necessary libraries for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
text preprocessing, model building, and visualization.
Loading Data: You loaded the dataset using pd.read_csv() function.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): You performed EDA by checking the shape of 
the dataset and visualizing the distribution of spam and ham messages using sns.countplot().
Downsampling: To balance the dataset, you downsampled the majority class 
(ham messages) to match the number of samples in the minority class (spam messages).
Text Preprocessing:
Removed stopwords from the text data using the remove_stopwords() function.
Created word clouds for both spam and ham messages using plot_word_cloud() function.

2. Building the Model:
Tokenization and Padding: You tokenized the text data and padded sequences to have the same length using Tokenizer and pad_sequences.
Model Architecture: Constructed an LSTM-based model using Sequential() API from TensorFlow Keras.
Model Compilation: Compiled the model using binary cross-entropy loss, accuracy metric, and Adam optimizer.


3. Training the Model:
Used fit() method to train the model on the preprocessed data.
Applied Early Stopping and Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.


4. Model Performance Evaluation:
Evaluated the model on the test data using evaluate() method to get test loss and accuracy.
Plotted the training and validation accuracy over epochs using matplotlib.
